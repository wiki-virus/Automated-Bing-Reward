2. To skip searching within the current profile, press and hold 'N' on your keyboard. This will close the current profile and automatically switch to the next one.
3. The main/default Edge profile will only be used at the end of the process, ensuring that when you reopen Edge after the program completes, it goes directly to your default account.
